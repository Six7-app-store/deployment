# Security group for the staging VM.
#
# Previously this was referenced by name only ("appstore-deploy") and had to be
# created by hand in the tenant — an undocumented prerequisite that made a fresh
# apply fail with a confusing "security group not found". Creating it here makes
# the environment self-contained.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT OPENED
# docker-compose.staging.yml publishes Postgres (5432), RabbitMQ (5672) and the
# RabbitMQ management UI (15672) on the host. The VM's fixed IP is publicly
# routable on this OpenStack (see infrastructure/README.md), so this security
# group is the ONLY thing keeping those services off the internet. Do not add
# rules for them — use an SSH tunnel if you need access.
